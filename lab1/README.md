Open the HTML file, and follow the instruction to draw all the shapes.

The re-display is implemented in the redisplayScreen() function, I clear all the buffer and then redraw. 


## States which bonus tasks you attempted
I tried to finish the both bonus point. 

The first one is drawing circles, you can press 'r' and click the mouse to draw it.

The second one is allow window resizing. In my implementation, the canvas size is the same the whole window size, and as the window size changes, all the shapes are repotioned and resized proportionally to the new window.
