##  Describes how to use your program
Open the HTML file, and follow the instruction to draw all the shapes and do all the transformation. 

## States which bonus tasks you attempted
I tried to finish the bonus point. 

When you click "A", you are going into "selecting one specific shape" mode. In this mode, after you click the left mouse, instead of drawing one shape, the program will search for the shape which is closest to mouse position, and check whether it is within a given distance range (here is 0.05). If the closest shape is in the range, then we can use mouse to rotate, 's/S' to scale, and 'r/g/b' to recolor. After you click "a", you are going back to the "drawing a new shape mode".
